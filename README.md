# Understanding TDD and Refactoring with Lego
## Bryan Beecham - Sep. 25, 2018

### Abstract
In this session we will learn the basics of Test Driven Design/Development (TDD) through the use of Lego. We will create failing tests, make them pass and then refactor. We wonâ€™t be writing software, we will be using Lego bricks and some other basic tools. By working with our hands these technical concepts that can be tricky to wrap your head around will be simplified.

The session begins with some background on TDD. Everyone will have their own Lego that we will use throughout the session. As the session progresses we will move from working by ourselves to pairs and finally in groups.

This session has been presented all over the world and is now used by many Agile coaches to help teach the concept of Test Driven Development.
